        <p>
            Today, more and more purchases are done through digital channels, especially via online payments. The internet
            offers
            the convenience and ease of buying goods or paying for services via your computer, tablet or mobile phones.
            However,
            the
            use of online payments is not without its risks. According to experts in the financial sector, Nigeria loses
            about
            N200
            billion per year to cybercrime.

            <li style="font-size: 1.5em;">INSIDER FRAUD</li>
            <p>
                Insider fraud involves an individual who works in the organization and has access to all vital information
                within the
                organisation. Such individuals use this privilege to steal private information such as bank account numbers,
                identity
                cards, etc to adopt peoples’ identities and engage in fraud.
                Tips:
                1. Never give your sensitive/confidential information such as account number, debit card, credit card,
                insurance
                number,
                etc over the phone or via email.
                2. Reconcile your bank account monthly, and notify your bank of any discrepancies immediately.
                3. Report unauthorized financial transactions to your bank as soon as you detect them.

            <li style="font-size: 1.5em;">PHISHING:</li>
            <p>
                Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent message designed to trick a
                person into
                revealing sensitive information to the attacker, or to deploy.Phishing has a simple approach like an email
                whcih
                redirects victim to a malicious site which captures, and steals information used to authenticate funds
                transfers out of
                the victim’s account.
            </p>

        </ul>

        <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Tips:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>New phishing attack methods are being developed all the time, but they share commonalities that can be
                identified by
                knowing what to look out for.
                For example, a malicious website most likely would appear like http://www.xyz.com instead of
                https://www.xyz.com. An
                internet user should pay attention to the letter (s) at the end of the domain name which simply indicates
                that a website
                is secure and safe to use.</li>
            <li>
                Do not click on a link in an email or instant message even if you know the sender. Hover over the link to
                double
                check if the destination is the authentic domain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not give your information to an unsecured website.
            </li>
            <li>Do not be tempted by pop-ups.</li>
        </ol>
